Convolutional layers are where filters (also known as the set of kernels) are applied or convolved with the original input images. These can be n-dimensional metrics to generate a feature map as an output.
This project aims to create predictive CNN models for classification tasks utilizing TensorFlow and Keras. Convolutional layers, where filters (kernels) convolve with input images, are crucial for feature extraction, producing feature maps as outputs. This project develops predictive CNN models for classification tasks using TensorFlow, Keras, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), pooling layers, dropout, backpropagation, batch normalization, optimization (Adam), data augmentation, and model evaluation techniques.
